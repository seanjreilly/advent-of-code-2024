# advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) [^1] solutions for 2024.
If you want to see how I did any of it, please feel free.

I'm doing all the coding using Kotlin, so I used the JetBrains [Advent of Code Kotlin Template](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-kotlin-template)
as a starting point, although I have since customised it extensively: it automatically downloads puzzle input files and
does other nice things. I use test-driven development because I always do (although it's a fun spare-time Christmas
project, so I may have skimped on coverage).

Unit tests are powered by [Junit](https://junit.org/junit5/), and I also use the excellent [Kotlin Power-assert compiler plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/power-assert.html)
for assertions and JetBrains IntelliJ as my IDE.

[^1]: Advent of Code is an annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015. Every year
since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
