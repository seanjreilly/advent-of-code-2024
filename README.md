# advent-of-code-2024

Welcome to my [Advent of Code][aoc] [^aoc] solutions for 2024. If you want to see how I did any of it, please feel free.

I'm doing all the coding using [Kotlin][kotlin], so I used the JetBrains [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template] as a
starting point, although I have since customised it extensively: it automatically downloads puzzle input files and does
other nice things. I use test-driven development because I always do (although it's a fun spare-time Christmas project,
so I may have skimped on coverage).

Unit tests are powered by [Junit](https://junit.org/junit5/), and I also use the excellent [Kotlin Power-assert compiler plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/power-assert.html)
for assertions and JetBrains IntelliJ as my IDE.

[^aoc]:
Advent of Code is an annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-four days.
You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
